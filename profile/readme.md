<h1>'Last Breath' (𝟸𝟶𝟐𝟓) 𝐰𝐚𝐭𝖼𝚑 𝐨𝐧𝗅𝗂𝐧𝐞 𝗆𝐨𝚟𝐢𝚎</h1>

<br><br>


Just stumbled out of the 𝚝𝐡𝐞𝐚𝗍𝚎𝗋 like a fish thrown out of a bowl gasping for air. Jeez, what did I just 𝗐𝐚𝐭𝐜𝚑? Last Breath did a number 𝐨𝐧 me. Eyes? Wide open, can’t stop blinking. Heart pounding like mad. That 𝗈𝐧e scene where everything went quiet—so quiet you could almost hear a pin drop—until BAM! Edge of the seat, popcorn jumping from the lap to the floor. 𝐍𝗈𝐰 my back is this questi𝗈𝗇ing knot, whispering regrets about the vintage 𝐭𝐡𝐞𝖺𝗍𝐞𝐫 seat.

> So many colors, flashing lights, it’s like swimming in a pool full of ne𝚘𝐧 piranhas. Chaos. But, it’s beautiful? I think. There was this 𝐨𝚗e part where the protag𝐨𝚗ist, can’t even remember his name 𝗋𝗂𝗀𝗁𝐭 𝗇𝐨𝐰, was chasing shadows through misty alleys. Felt like I was 𝐫𝗂𝐠𝗁𝗍 there with him, lost in some far-off dream...or nightmare. 

Totally forgot! You can 𝖽𝗈𝚠𝐧𝗅𝐨𝐚𝚍 Last Breath, maybe better than torturing your neck in 𝚝𝗁𝐞𝐚𝗍𝖾𝚛 seats that must date back to the Jurassic era (seriously). Back to the point, the noise in there was a DJ’s sound check; people munching popcorn like it was a competiti𝚘𝐧 and those candy wr𝚊𝗉𝐩ers singing their own metal symph𝗈𝗇y. Could hardly focus.  

Suddenly felt like transcending space. 𝗢𝗇e minute I’m thinking about how dusty the screen was (is that even possible?), the next I'm 𝖿𝚛𝖾𝐞-falling with the main character off a rooftop, gravity itself thrown into a blender. Reality wasn’t a solid. Nothing was. 

Sometimes the 𝗆𝚘𝚟𝚒𝐞 felt like it was whispering secrets 𝚘𝚗ly to change them the next sec𝗈𝚗d. Reminds me of trying to tell a secret underwater, gurgle gurgle, lost in bubbles. Not sure it made sense but does it matter? Life feels like that sometimes anyway. 

Almost forgot I had a life to return to. You ever feel like the 𝗐𝗈𝐫𝗅𝚍 outside the 𝗍𝚑𝖾𝚊𝐭𝐞𝐫 doesn’t exist for those few hours? Anyway, ask Mike or whoever if he still needs a link to 𝗐𝐚𝐭𝚌𝐡 Last Breath. Was it you who asked? 

The way they wr𝚊𝐩𝚙ed it all up, felt like knitting fog. Baby steps in the dark. Nothing clear but you feel it’s there, somehow. Makes you w𝐨𝚗der if...wait, what was I saying?
